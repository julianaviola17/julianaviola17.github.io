  <p>
This project is certainly incomplete; going forward, I would need to work on the remaining four acts. Initially, I thought I could take on the whole play, but choosing just six songs took hours -- much longer than I expected.

I also know that selecting the music for a film is only the first step in music supervising. For a real movie, I would need to think about editing songs to change the length or add in breaks for dramatic emphasis. I would also need to make sure the music wouldnâ€™t overpower the dialogue. The timing of the music is absolutely critical, as well. In a scene with music, everything is timed to fall on the downbeats of each measure. A real music supervisor would work with her director to make choices about how footage would align with music. I might also consult with a team about their reactions to my choices and their interpretations of each scene.
