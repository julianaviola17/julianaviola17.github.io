For my creative project, I chose to take on the role of “music supervisor” for a movie version of “The Tempest,” meaning I would be responsible for selecting the film’s soundtrack. I worked on Act I of the romance. I pictured movie that would follow a fairly traditional portrayal of the script, but I wanted the movie to be more accessible to modern audiences. One way to engage the audience and better their understanding is through music, which can set an appropriate tone for a scene or force an idea about a certain character or theme.

To create my soundtrack, I listened to some of <a href=”http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9764-the-50-best-albums-of-2015/”>the best albums of 2015</a>, watched movies, and looked back at some of the jazz and classical piano pieces I’ve played. I created a preliminary list of songs and put them on in the background as I read through their corresponding scenes. I then decided if the music fit with the vibe I was trying to create for each moment. The soundtrack for Act I, with music from 1888 to 2015, features a range of genres: classical, jazz, electronic, experimental, and avant-garde.

In order to display my work, I’ve created this website to house the script of Act I. To the right of the script, I added in the songs I feel would work for each moment. If you click on each song, you can listen to it as you read the script. I decided to have the script and the songs next to each other for two reasons. First, I wanted people to be able to experience my vision for each scene. But also, and maybe more importantly, I hope the format will allow people to decide if my creative decisions work for them and what they might do differently. All music is subjective, as are my interpretations of “The Tempest.” I wrote a blurb under each song explaining my thought process, but I do not expect everyone to agree with my decisions.
